I used Angular framework 16 for the project
and WebStorm Environment.

When you go to main page you will find
only one login form. If your account created
and not blocked you will go to the chart page.

For currencies chart you can use files with
data more than 1 year 
(I tested application with data of 23 years).
The file with data is located in assets/data
folder and can be replaced anytime.
A file with data can contains empty cells and
skipped dates because application can create
graphics with skipped dates and data.

You can change graphics view by slider button
between spline and lines. Also, you can zooming
chart by buttons, calenders, special viewbar
under chart and by mouse cursor selected area
on chart. If you hold Shift + Left Mouse Button
you can panning chart.

If you are logged from account with admin access,
you will find (Users) button in the top of the panel and
you won't find it if your account has only user access.
A user managment form it is the form where you
can add, update and delete users information.
You can't change UserID parameter after creating
a new user account. But, you can change everything else.
You can't delete Admin user account, but you can
delete accounts with admin access.

When you press the button (Log Out), you will go
to the login page.
